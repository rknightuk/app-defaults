      <p>Recently, folks have been sharing their default apps in a bunch of different categories. (I’m told the podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://hemisphericviews.com/">Hemispheric Views</a> started this. I plan on listening soon.)</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for learning about other people’s workflows and seeing how I can make better use of my time, so this was right up my alley.</p>
<p>In recent years I have drastically simplified the amount of third party apps I use. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel of finding and using the latest mail client, RSS reader, to-do list, etc.</p>
<p>I still keep my ear to the ground about the hot new productivity app but I have to be really sure it’s sticking around before I swap away from the default Apple option. Apple’s apps don’t always have the latest flashy features but I generally expect them to be around for the next five years.</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here are my default apps:</p>
<p>📨 Mail Client</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Mail</li>
</ul>
<p>📮 Mail Server</p>
<ul>
<li>GSuite (Is it still called this? I’m considering switching to FastMail but haven’t pulled the trigger yet.)</li>
</ul>
