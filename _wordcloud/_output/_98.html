<div><p>The Hemispheric Views podcast that <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/096">I was on</a> the other week had a fun <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">Duel of the Defaults</a> episode last week.</p>
<p>Do you use the default stuff that comes with the computer, or something else?</p>
<p>I definitely feel like mine has tended more to the default over the last five years. Here it is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail Client: Mail.app.</li>
<li>Mail Server: <a target="_blank" href="https://migadu.com/">Migadu</a>. Love Migadu, 💯</li>
<li>Notes: <a target="_blank" href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, sorry @canion.</li>
<li>To-Do: Scrap of paper and pencil; Reminders for longer-term, remind-me-on-a-day.
<ul>
<li>Though I never use Reminders.app: stuff gets in there via Siri or Fantastical, and Fantastical tells me it’s due.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iPhone Photo Shooting: Camera, from the Home Screen button.
<ul>
<li>I wish I could turn off the swipe, I only do it by accident and I realise when my phone sets on fire in my pocket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Photo Management: Photos.
<ul>
<li>It’s just a decade of chaos in there worth 200GB of my iCloud storage. Mostly photos of whiteboards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calendar: Fantastical/iCloud.</li>
<li>Cloud file storage: iCloud, and the Synology under the desk.</li>
<li>RSS: NetNewsWire sync’d with iCloud.</li>
<li>Contacts: Contacts.
<ul>
<li>Which I brought to the first iPhone from my Nokia, and have never deleted a single one, and they’re all immaculately tagged with the label and the international number format, and I have 1,690 — the vast, vast majority of which I have <em>no idea</em> who they are any more; but if I’ve ever met you, you’re in there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser: Safari, even for development; I switched to its dev tools last year, they’re terrific.</li>
<li>Chat: iMessage/Discord.</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Safari, although I don’t really keep bookmarks.
<ul>
<li>The trick is to set your history to never expire (<em>Safari &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Remove history items: Manually</em>), and then every site you’ve ever visited will autocomplete, so why bother with bookmarks?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read It Later: <code>null</code>, don’t use; is that -1 points, @canion?</li>
<li>Word Processing: Pages, or VSCode because I need Vim keybindings.</li>
<li>Spreadsheets: Excel.
<ul>
<li>Sorry Numbers but nah.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presentations: <a target="_blank" href="https://ia.net/presenter">iA Presenter</a>. Lush OMG.
<ul>
<li>Worth downloading for the video that plays when it launches; the only video in all of history that I ask to play again the next time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shopping Lists: A <a target="_blank" href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> notebook and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2022/11/21/mitsubishi-9850-hb-pencil-review">Mitsubishi 9850</a> pencil.</li>
<li>Meal Planning: I keep recipes in <a target="_blank" href="https://mela.recipes/">Mela.app</a> which is <em>amazing</em>.</li>
<li>Budgeting &amp; Personal Finance: <code>null</code> unless you count my bank’s iPhone app?</li>
<li>News: after doom-scrolling Covid for the entirety of 2020 I stopped reading all news as of 2021. I haven’t been to a news site since then. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done for my mental health.
<ul>
<li>Of course, I get news. I see Lucy’s screen; she tells me things; people send me links; we put the radio on. This isn’t a religious thing … I just don’t browse it, myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Music: Apple Music.
<ul>
<li>Typing this listening to Texas’ 1989 (?!!?!) - album ‘Southside’ because it was suggested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Podcasts: Overcast.</li>
<li>Passwords: 1Password.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s now 98 99 of these that <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">Robb Knight has collected here</a>.</p></div><div><div><p>┌</p><p>
